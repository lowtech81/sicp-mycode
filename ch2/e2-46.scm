; Exercise 2.46.  A two-dimensional vector v running from the origin to
; a point can be represented as a pair consisting of an x-coordinate and
; a y-coordinate. Implement a data abstraction for vectors by giving a
; constructor make-vect and corresponding selectors xcor-vect and
; ycor-vect. In terms of your selectors and constructor, implement
; procedures add-vect, sub-vect, and scale-vect that perform the
; operations vector addition, vector subtraction, and multiplying a
; vector by a scalar:
; 
; (x1, y1) + (x2, y2) = (x1 + x2, y1 + y2)
; (x1, y1) - (x2, y2) = (x1 - x2, y1 - y2)
; s*(x, y) = (s*x, s*y)
;

(define (add-vect v1 v2)
    (make-vect (+ (xcor-vect v1) (xcor-vect v2)) (+ (ycor-vect v1) (ycor-vect v2))))

(define (sub-vect v1 v2)
    (make-vect (- (xcor-vect v1) (xcor-vect v2)) (- (ycor-vect v1) (ycor-vect v2))))

(define (scale-vect s v)
